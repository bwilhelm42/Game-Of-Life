Creating a visual display
    Frameworks? SDL seems good, but maybe overkill. Netbpm is a possible option, but maybe too much work to print simple images
        As of now, planning on using SDL
    display every frame to show movement?
    display just the fram of repetition? <-- This one is more inline with monitoring performance advancements

Evaluating oscilating board states
    use a constant max cycle number <-- straight forward and logical, but breaks badly if the cycle exceeds this value
    need a fixed board size in the event of a shape that infinitely generates in order to force some kind of 'steady' states
